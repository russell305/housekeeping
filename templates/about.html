    <h2>House Cleaning Miami</h2>
    <p>  I created this platform because I was unhappy with the options presented to house cleaners and consumers. Other
    platforms are over-engineered and purely foucused on extracting as much money as possible from their users.
    As opposed to solving their user's issues.</p>

    <p><b>House Cleaners:  </b>Platforms extract a percentage of every dollar a house cleaner earns, or
      they will charge a $20 fee if somebody emails the house cleaner to ask a queston.  They call this a "Lead".  These practices unfair to the people doing the actual
      work.  Here I offer a platform where house cleaners can offer their services for reasonable price.
      <!-- <p id = "green">We charge only $2.99 per month.  You can cancel at anytime with -->
        <!-- no extra charges.</p> -->
				<!-- <form action="{{ url_for('signup') }}" method="post"> -->
					<!-- <button class="btn btn-success btn-sm active " aria-pressed="true">Sign Up</button> -->
				<!-- </form> -->


<p><b>Consumers:  </b>Most platforms require users to insert personal data subjet to hackers.  Name, address, email, phone,
  bank information, etc.  Others make you join a subscription service where you have your house cleaned twice a month for a year.  Here
  I want to simplify the process where you can compare house cleaning services, and call and talk to the ones you like.
